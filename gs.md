# "Shooting ranges are dirty."
# "I'm uncomfortable around all these people."

## “I’ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half. It's beautiful software that has resisted every wrong trend and stayed true to the things that mattered most. Highly recommended.”

## “We can see exactly what needs to be done and when. We're much more efficient.”

## “We've had less confusion with task responsibilities and deadlines, which has increased productivity and efficiency.”

## “We are all collaborating more on feedback, it helps to show accountability as well.”

## “Task completion! The lists and reminders help people remember what they said they were going to do and helps hold them accountable to the team.”
