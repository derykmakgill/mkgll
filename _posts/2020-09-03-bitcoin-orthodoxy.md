title: Bitcoin orthodoxy
---

When I first learned about Bitcoin, people told me a lot of interesting things about it. 

"Bitcoin is digital gold."

"Bitcoin is anarchist and Satoshi created it to destroy governments." 

"Code is law and nobody controls Bitcoin."

"Bitcoin cannot be seized or traced." 

"Bitcoin comes from the cypherpunks like Wei Dai."

"Bitcoin can't scale."

Both because a lot of people I respected were saying it, and more importantly, because a lot of what was said aligned with my own moral and political views, I accepted it. I'm somewhat ashamed to say many years later that I accepted it somewhat blindly.

Well, I didn't accept all of it. To be fair to my younger self, I always thought Bitcoin could scale. It seemed absurd to think even an offensively conservative 1mb increase to the block size would break Bitcoin. But I did however accept mostly without question a lot of what I now call the Bitcoin Orthodoxy. 

I chose the word, *orthoxody,* because it comes from the Greek word ὀρθοδοξία, meaning "the righteous opinion." To me, that's exactly what the set of beliefs that make up the Bitcoin Orthodoxy have become. It's a religion. If you accept it fully and without questioning, you're part of the enlightened few saved by its grace. The priesthood will invite you to conferences full of hired female entertainment or maybe a private raw steak dinner. If you question it, be prepared to be [slandered and ostracised](https://powping.com/posts/a6f3b1a920c18e5862db20fbd0a59132cc9b0406f3647f50d6d071a6bebb1275) by people you thought were friends.

Although I've never participated in the witchunts that are so popular in the Bitcoin industry except to defend people against them, it wasn't until 2017, nearly five years after I had first heard of Bitcoin, that I began to seriously question this orthodoxy itself. 

That's what this essay is about. It points to some important findings that I've had during my time in Bitcoin that helped me "wake up" from the Bitcoin Orthodoxy. It's not a definitive theory of Bitcoin so much as it is a splash of cold water for people who still unquestioningly believe the Orthodoxy. We're smashing a few idols but we aren't building much back up now. For me, I learned more about what I could expect from Bitcoin and what I shouldn't expect, and thus where I should focus my time and energy and where I shouldn't.
