title: Bitcoin orthodoxy
---

When I first learned about Bitcoin, people told me a lot of interesting things about it. 

"Bitcoin is anarchist and Satoshi created it to destroy governments." 

"Bitcoin cannot be seized or traced." 

"Bitcoin comes from the cypherpunks like Wei Dai."

"Bitcoin can't scale."

Both because a lot of people I respected were saying it, and more importantly, because a lot of what was said aligned with my own moral and political views, I accepted it. I'm somewhat ashamed to say many years later that I accepted it somewhat blindly.

Well, I didn't accept all of it. To be fair to my younger self, I always thought Bitcoin could scale. It seemed absurd to think even an offensively conservative 1mb increase to the block size would break Bitcoin. But I did however accept mostly without question a lot of what I now call the Bitcoin Orthodoxy. 

I chose the word, *orthoxody,* because it comes from the Greek word ὀρθοδοξία, meaning "the righteous opinion." To me, that's exactly what the set of beliefs that make up the Bitcoin Orthodoxy have become. It's a religion. If you accept it fully and without questioning, you're part of the enlightened few saved by its grace. If you question it, be prepared to be [slandered and ostracised](https://powping.com/posts/a6f3b1a920c18e5862db20fbd0a59132cc9b0406f3647f50d6d071a6bebb1275) by people you thought were friends.

>The split between BSV and BCH was a low point in my life. Many of the people who I thought were my friends turned on me in a two week period and started bashing me publicly on social media. They went from friends to enemies in a heartbeat. That was a rough lesson. It made me question everything I was doing in life. It is not something I ever want to experience again.

Although I've never participated in the witchunts that are so popular in the Bitcoin industry, it wasn't until 2017, nearly five years after I had first heard of Bitcoin, that I began to seriously question this orthodoxy itself.
