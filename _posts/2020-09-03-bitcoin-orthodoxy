title: Bitcoin orthodoxy
---

When I first learned about Bitcoin, people told me a lot of interesting things about it. 

"Bitcoin is digital gold."

"It is desirable that Bitcoin should be truly anonymous."

"Bitcoin is anarchist and Satoshi created it to destroy governments." 

"Code is law and nobody controls Bitcoin."

"Bitcoin cannot be seized or traced." 

"Bitcoin comes from the cypherpunks like Wei Dai."

"Bitcoin can't scale."

Both because a lot of people I respected were saying it, and more importantly, because a lot of what was said aligned with my own moral and political views, I accepted it. I'm somewhat ashamed to say many years later that I accepted it somewhat blindly.

Well, I didn't accept all of it. To be fair to my younger self, I always thought Bitcoin could scale. It seemed absurd to think even an offensively conservative 1mb increase to the block size would break Bitcoin. But I did however accept mostly without question a lot of what I now call the Bitcoin Orthodoxy. 

I chose the word, *orthoxody,* because it comes from the Greek word ὀρθοδοξία, meaning "the righteous opinion." To me, that's exactly what the set of beliefs that make up the Bitcoin Orthodoxy have become. It's a religion. If you accept it fully and without questioning, you're part of the enlightened few saved by its grace. The priesthood will invite you to conferences full of hired female entertainment or maybe a private raw steak dinner. If you question it, be prepared to be [slandered and ostracised](https://powping.com/posts/a6f3b1a920c18e5862db20fbd0a59132cc9b0406f3647f50d6d071a6bebb1275) by people you thought were friends.

Although I've never participated in the witchunts that are so popular in the Bitcoin industry except to defend people against them, it wasn't until 2017, nearly five years after I had first heard of Bitcoin, that I began to seriously question this orthodoxy itself. 

That's what this essay is about. It points to some important findings that I've had during my time in Bitcoin that helped me "wake up" from the Bitcoin Orthodoxy. It's not a definitive theory of Bitcoin so much as it is a splash of cold water for people who still unquestioningly believe the Orthodoxy. We're smashing a few idols but we aren't building much back up now. For me, I learned more about what I could expect from Bitcoin and what I shouldn't expect, and thus where I should focus my time and energy and where I shouldn't.

## Anonymity and Bitcoin

> …the political point is that if you can make an untraceable payment, you could be coerced into doing so, for example by being robbed at gunpoint. Contrariwise, if the cash system used by you and your bank is such that all money is inherently traceable, it will be a lot harder to commit robbery, extortion, kidnapping, and all those other horrors which people fear will come with digital cash.

The not totally invincible nature of Bitcoin's privacy certainly makes conversations with LE a bit easier (I've had a couple of conversations with UK LE already and want to have more at the conference).

I think it's really important to understand that privacy and anonymity are not really the same thing. If I send money to or from Mt Gox, then I've probably had to go through KYC and I'm not anonymous to them (or you), but that transaction is still private - you can't find out I did it from the block chain. It might seem like an academic point but people have very different emotional reactions to privacy (good!) vs anonymity (scary!).

Bitcoin should seek to provide privacy. It's unacceptable that someone might earn their salary in Bitcoins and then have a colleague discover their income by analysing the block chain. That's actually the kind of privacy leak that tends to bother people most in their every day life, most people aren't trying to make an enemy of their own governments. But at the same time, we should make it easy for people to prove their identities to each other, mostly because this can help grease the wheels of trade. Zero trust protocols are great when you can make them work, but it's often quite tricky and taking personal legal responsibility for your actions is a model everyone is already familiar with.

Right now bitcoinj has woeful privacy, we've spent our time optimising performance and reliability of backups rather than that. But in future I'd hope we can make some of the improvements I listed above. It will help ordinary people a lot, and I don't think it'd make much difference to LE investigations. The thing that'd help them the most is people knowing who they're trading with, so they can try and "follow the money" by getting the relevant warrants for each step in the chain.

I don't think it's reasonable to say the "point" of BitCoin is anonymity. That's just a quick way to get the whole endevour classified as a complicated and unusual money laundering operation. And not all of us care about anonymity, or we might care but only for an alternative persona and the bulk of trades are still done under our real identity.

BitCoin has many advantages over traditional electronic payments. It's not even especially great for anonymity today,


The idea of decentralised crime fighting is to present a credible alternative to today's world in which the NSA/Treasury/FinCEN/etc  has a giant database of all financial transactions and mines them looking for terrorists. This arrangement is incredibly dangerous, opening as it does huge potential for abuse as we saw with WikiLeaks, but it also just undermines basic human dignity and is likely to produce huge numbers of false positives. And finally it reinforces the world view that solving social problems means giving ever more power to an ever larger state, a view not many of us have sympathy with. But simply saying the entire crime fighting apparatus should vanish will simply not be seen as credible by the people who were voted in to make those decisions.

So the question is can we imagine an entirely libertarian or even anarchist society in which people voluntarily co-operate to trace thieves and fraudsters? I think it's possible...

Once upon a time bitcoin.org called Bitcoin “anonymous” but that was a mistake, and for at least two years “we” (core developers) have tried to be careful to say that, at best, Bitcoin is pseudanonymous.

I tell reporters that Bitcoin is more private than using any other online payment method, but less private than cash (unless you know a lot about how it works under the covers and jump through several hoops to keep your identity secret).
