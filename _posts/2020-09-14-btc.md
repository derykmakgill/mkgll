**ABSTRACT:** This article discusses Operation Atlantis, a project by a millionaire
pharmaceutical entrepreneur, Werner K. Stiefel, to build a libertarian micronation off the
coast of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It reviews the history and
motivations behind Operation Atlantis and discusses how it relates to contemporary
libertarian new-nation ventures. Operation Atlantis developed in parallel to ‘back-to-theland’ communities, which used small-scale technology to return to a ‘natural’ state
through simplicity and self-sufficiency. But the main influence on Stiefel’s project was Ayn
Rand’s Atlas Shrugged (1957), a novel inscribed with her Objectivist philosophy that tells
the story of a group of millionaire industrialists who find refuge in a hidden community,
Galt’s Gulch, also referred to as Atlantis. Interestingly, in recent years, a number of new
offshore micronational projects sharing common influences and purposes and, in their
own way, reviving the legacy of Operation Atlantis, have been launched in the United
States. The Seasteading Institute is a non-profit working to build floating island nations.
Designed as a ‘post-political’ manufactured space, Stiefel’s Operation Atlantis and
seasteading borrow aspects of the cruise ship. To better understand the motivations
behind Operation Atlantis and similar projects and to situate them within Island Studies,
it is helpful to adopt Hayward’s concept of aquapelagos and uncover the disconnection
between libertarian offshore micronations and the aquatic environment they intend to
occupy.

**KEYWORDS:** Operation Atlantis, micronations, seasteading, libertarianism

## Introduction

What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.

To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.

Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.

For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.

Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.

It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.

Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.
