Mike Hearn is probably the most lied about Bitcoiner of all time. He's also the most important, and Bitcoin might be much more successful today if people had listened to him. I've gathered several years worth of his best quotes from BitcoinTalk during my research into the history of Bitcoin.

> I don't see any way for Bitcoin to have any real impact in a country where using it is illegal. There are about a million ways a government can round up Bitcoin users beyond strange mathematical games - most obviously, find anyone advertising a price in Bitcoins and punish them. For people to use Bitcoin they have to be able to spend it, and to be able to spend it you need to find merchants willing to accept it, and for a merchant to accept it requires advertising that fact.

> Satoshi was probably not a hard core crypto anarchist. He started to back away from the project around the time people were suggesting WikiLeaks should accept donations with it (what he called "kicking the hornets nest"). I doubt he would have been happy about the Silk Road, which opened just two months after he stopped posting publicly.

> No, it's quite apparent most miners just aren't thinking about block sizes at all. Jim is correct. The right solution to this is for miners to make bigger blocks. Bitcoin is still tiny. Having people "fight" for block space via fees today is ridiculous. Rather than telling people to set higher fees, go talk to miners and tell them that you're sometimes having problems with transactions taking a long time to confirm. Or better yet, build visualisations so miners can see it for themselves.
