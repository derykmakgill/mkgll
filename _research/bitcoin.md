title: The Great Bitcoin Scaling Debate â€” An Annotated Timeline
date: 2020-07-23
---

I attempt to show through a chronology of primary source material that Bitcoin was systematically hijacked and directed against its original vision of scaling on-chain. 

I do not claim that scaling on-chain is the proper way to scale Bitcoin, only that it was the way *intended* by Satoshi Nakamoto and early Bitcoiners, and that technical and economic arguments against scaling on-chain played a less important role in the eventual outcome than censorship, propaganda, etc.

### 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman
>
>He has demonstrated this in numerous ways.
>
>The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time.
>
>No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

### 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

### 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

### 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

### May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

>A lesson for micropayment efforts is that mental costs usually exceed, and
often dwarf, the computational costs. Reductions in the per transaction computational costs of transactions may often be economically insignificant. Other transaction costs addressable by hardware or software, such as security concerns,
as well as costs of better communicating product quality versus price tradeoffs
in the user interface, are usually more important ob jectives for technological
cost reduction than conserving on computational or network resources.

### ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

### 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/)

>(Copied from WP:AN/3RR, because there were edits that amounted to vandalism, as well as excessive reverting)
>
>He has reverted Template:User freedom seven times despite repeated calls to stop from multiple editors. The version he is reverting to is far different from what the creators and users intended it for. I consider these edits to be an act of vandalism.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>Yes, I inadvertently fell foul of that a while ago. On that occasion, though, the person who alerted me merely removed the image and left me a polite note in explanation. Gmaxwell has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively with regard to image violations (real or occasionally imagined). Here, he's misapplying a rule about fair-use images to the use of public-domain images, and doing so in a heavy-handed manner.

>I've spoken to him several times about his aggression, since a dispute I had with him recently about an image (in which he called me "hysterical" and accused me of vandalism because I dared to revert his removal of it). What with this today and his behavior last night (see above), I'm unsure of the best way is to proceed, but something needs to happen.

>His behaviour is outrageous. Firstly, where fairuse images are wrongly on user pages it is invariably due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to break the law. All he had to do was leave a message, not post a massive notice all but accusing the user of being a lawbreaker. Secondly, he is not removing the offending image, but all images, even those that can be displayed. Thirdly, blanking a user's page is grossly disrespectful to other users. Frankly, he is out of control at this stage. This bullying behavour of his has to stop.

>I move that all his edits be reverted and considered petty vandalism, and that the said user be blocked for a period of one week. We don't have time to entertain him or his dubious edits.

>OK, his contribs list is beyond the pale. It's vandalism, pretty clearly.

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

>He's not known for making "reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation," unfortunately, but for acts of aggression that have led other users to leave the project. I'm concerned that, in his most recent statements, he has announced his intention to continue being disruptive, and has said he'll evade any blocks that are applied. That's a direct threat to the project, not an attempt to protect it.

>Today he seemed to indicate he has no intention of following our policies:
>
>"Like I give a crap about being blocked, it doesn't even inhibit me from editing."
>
>"Man. You think I've stopped because I'm blocked? Please! Blocking doesn't actually stop anyone but twits!" 
>
>"You're still wrong about me being blocked accomplishing *anything*, since I can still edit whenever I please... in fact, being blocked gives me far less incentive to be nice about it, in so far as there can be far less than nearly none at all."
>
>"I feel great because I can still do what I want, and I don't have to worry what rude jerks think about me ... I can continue to do whatever I think is right without the burden of explaining myself to a shreaking [sic] mass of people." 
>
>That's not even to mention the personal attacks.

>My opinion of this user is that he is a very dangerous individual whose edits speak for themselves. Full of sarcasm, threats, rude insults, impersonations of an admin, not to mention massive disprect of other users and blanking of user pages. I'm all about forgiving, but this is banable behavior. If further incidents occur, a ban would be warranted.
